# minecraft_racoon
*THIS PROJECT IS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH THE OFFICIAL MINECRAFT STUDIO AND IS A NON-PROFIT PROJECT MADE FOR SPECIFICALLY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE*

I created a what looks like a blue raccoon with some sounds added to the entity. The entity is tamed with potatos
and is immensely scared of chickens. I used BlockBench to create the model, texture, and the animation of the entity.

There are two ways in summoning the entity: either you may use the /summon command in game (/summon jamesmod:raccoon)
or with an egg that I added into the creative inventory
